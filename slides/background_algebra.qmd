## Euclidean spaces

#### (Euclidean) distance between 2 vectors

\begin{equation*}
  \distance(\bx, \by) = \| \bx - \by \|.
\end{equation*}

Remark that when $\bx$ and $\by$ are orthogonal and non zero, distances between $\bx$ and $\by$ and $\bx$ and $(-\by)$ are the same. Then, 

\begin{equation*}
  (\bx - \by)^\top(\bx - \by) = (\bx + \by)^\top(\bx + \by) \Leftrightarrow \bx^\top\by  = 0,
\end{equation*}
  
which motivates the following definition of orthorgonality:

#### Orthogonality

Two vectors $\bx, \by \neq \bzero$ are orthogonal iff $\bx^\top \by = 0$.

#### Orthogonal projection

It is the vector $\bz$ such that

1. $\bz = \lambda \by$
2. $\by$  is orthogonal to $\bx - \bz$
  
We find $\lambda =\bx^\top \by / \|\by \|^2$

Thanks to Pythagoras theorem, 

\begin{equation*}
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{\|\bz\|}{\|\bx\|} = \lambda \frac{\|\by\|}{\|\bx\|}
\end{equation*}
and then we end with the following geometric definition of the dot product
  
#### Dot product: geometric definition

\begin{equation*}
  \bx^\top \by = \cos (\theta) \| \bx \| \,  \| \by \| 
\end{equation*}
