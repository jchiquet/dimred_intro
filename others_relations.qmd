## Isomap
 
#### Basic idea

  - Metric  MDS performs embedding based on pairwise Euclidean-based distance
  - Isomap embeds a distance induced by a neighborhood graph
 
Formally, consider a neighborhood $\mathcal{N}_i$ for each point, then

$$
  d_{ii'} = \left\{
    \begin{array}{cc}
    + \infty & \text{ if }j \notin \mathcal{N}_i\\
    \| \bx_i - \bx_{i'} \|& \\
    \end{array}
  \right.,
$$

and compute the shortest path distance for each pair prior to MDS.
