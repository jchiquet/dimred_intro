## Exploratory analysis of (modern) data sets

Assume a table with $n$ individuals described by $p$ features/variables
  
### Questions

Look for _patterns_ or _structures_ to summarize the data by
   
- Finding _groups_ of "similar" individuals
- Finding variables _important_ for these data
- Performing _visualization_

### Challenges

- **Size**: data may be _large_ ("big data": large $n$ large $p$)    
- **Dimension**: data may be _high dimensional_ ($n \ll p$)
- **Redundancy** many variables may carry the _same information_
- **Unsupervised** we _don't necessary know_ what we are looking after

## An example in genetics: 'snp' .fragile

Genetics variant in European population

#### Description: \textcolor{black}{\it medium/large data, high-dimensional}

500, 000 Genetics variants (SNP -- Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) for  3000 individuals (1 meter $\times$ 166 meter (height $\times$ width)

:::: columns

::: {.column width="37%"}

- SNP : 90 \% of human genetic variations
- coded as 0, 1 or 2 (0, 1 or 2 allel different against the population reference)

In the original messy $3,000 \times 500,000$ table, we may find
 
- an extremely strong structure between individuals (_"clustering"_)
- a very simple subspace where it is obvious (_"dimension reduction"_)

## Dimension reduction: general goals

Main objective: find a \alert{\bf low-dimensional representation} that captures the "essence" of (high-dimensional) data


#### Application in Machine Learning
  
 _Preprocessing, Regularization_
  
- Compression, denoising,  anomaly detection
- Reduce overfitting in supervised learning

#### Application in Statistics/Data analysis
    
_Better understanding of the data_
    
- descriptive/exploratory methods
- visualization (difficult to plot and interpret $> 3d$!)
